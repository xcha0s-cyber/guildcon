Talk: Speaker Name:  Vic Fernandez . Time : 10:30 - 10:45 +  Q/A 15 mintes     Talk Title : "Harnessing AI to Disrupt and Evaluate Security (HADES) " Description : "Traditional tools used to facilitate cyber defense training are inaccurate, inefficient, or overly complex--leaving stakeholders uncertain about their blue team's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threat actors. This presentation introduces HADES, a free and open-source software solution that uses AI to dynamically introduce realistic scenarios during cyber defense training exercises.

Attendees will learn how HADES uses multi-agent conversation patterns and open-source penetration tools to stress-test the blue team. They will learn how HADES addresses technical challenges like removing the need for prompt engineering expertise throughout the user experience, ensuring realism while mitigating risk, and enforcing rules of engagement. Attendees will also explore how AI-powered applications like HADES could shape the future of self-development for blue teamers.

The presentation will be structured as follows: introduction (2 minutes), motivation that led to the creation of HADES (3 minutes), and a live demonstration of running HADES (10 minutes).

Talk: Speaker Name: Grey Fox  . time 11:00 - 12:00  Talk Title :"Going AFK: A Discussion on Standing Up and Standing Out"  Description : "Going AFK (away from keyboard) means a lot of things. For a hacker exercising their First Amendment rights these days, it means serious preparation and answering hard questions. It means finding the safest and most survivable course of action for yourself and your group. Security-minded planning for events here, or in any city, demands site surveys, proper clothing and tools, digital privacy, escape and evasion, and checklists for all of it. Let's cover some of these essentials and give ourselves a head start.

Talk: Speaker Name: Dean Galitsis  . time 12:15 - 12:30  Talk Title :"Under the Wireless Security Hood: Why RF Basics Matter for Security and Resiliency"  Description : "WeI’ll explore why a solid understanding of radio principles—rooted in amateur (ham) radio—remains highly relevant to modern cybersecurity practice. Wi-Fi, cellular networks, GPS, and many other technologies we defend every day are fundamentally radio systems, and recognizing that helps us better understand their vulnerabilities, failure modes, and attack surfaces. We’ll also highlight how ham radio offers unique advantages for business continuity and disaster response, providing resilient, decentralized communication channels when conventional infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. By reconnecting with the foundational physics and practical skills of radio, cybersecurity professionals can strengthen both their defensive insight and their operational resilience. "

Talk: Speaker Name: Saul Wells Time 15:00 - 15:45 Q/A 15 mintes  Talk Title : "The Right to Repair: Ownership, Planet, and Prosperity " Description :  " Join Saul David Wells Jr., Founder of Mana Gaming LLC, for a powerful exploration of the
Right to Repair movement.
This is not merely a plea for consumer convenience; it is an essential pillar of property
ownership, environmental responsibility, and local small business viability.
Saul, an expert electronics repair professional, will break down this critical issue through three
core lenses:
● The Principle of Ownership: Why buying a product should mean truly owning it—with
the full right to fix or modify it—instead of agreeing to a "de facto lease" dictated by
manufacturers. He will expose the proprietary fasteners and digital locks (Part Pairing)
manufacturers use to engineer repair out of existence.
● The Catastrophe of E-Waste: How the manufactured inability to repair fuels the global
e-waste crisis. Saul will share how Mana Gaming breathes life back into devices, arguing
that the Right to Repair must include an ethical demand for open-sourcing End-of-Life
(EOL) products to extend their lifespan indefinitely.
● The Promise of a Repair Economy: How granting access to schematics and parts is a
powerful engine for local prosperity, creating stable, skilled jobs. Saul will discuss the
vital role of independent repair shops and how his own intro to electronic repair classes
empower the next generation with technological literacy and problem-solving skills.
This talk is a call to action to end the culture of manufactured disposal and make the Right to
Repair a reality."

Talk: Speaker Name: Josh McIntyre (chaintuts)  Time 16:00 - 16:45 Q/A 15 mintes  Talk Title : "Cryptography for Hackers and Engineers" Description :"* Cryptography is foundational to a lot of security practices and secure software engineering...but it can
be a little confusing at times
* This talk is about understanding crypto and its applications for the average security professional,
hacker, and software engineer - we'll cover the big 3 that most often apply to practices - hashing,
asymmetric cryptography (signatures and encryption), and symmetric encryption.
* Hashing - one way functions that mix up data - one output for one input, the same output every time
- Use cases: Password hashing
- Use cases: blockchains - POW mining, transaction ids
- Use cases: file integrity verification
* Asymmetric encryption and digital signatures - public/private keys
- Use cases: TLS encryption between client/server (HTTPS)
- Use cases: Passwordless auth (server stores pubkey, user signs auth message with privkey)
- Use cases: digital currency transactions
* Symmetric encryption - uses a key (or a stretched password) to encrypt data
- Use case: full disk encryption
- Use case: file encryption using a password

Talk: Speaker Name: ART  Time 17:00 - 17:45 Q/A 15 mintes  Talk Title : " Beyond the Clip: Modern Firmware Extraction in the Real World " Description : " Most talks on firmware ripping stop at “find the pads, hook the UART, clip the flash.” This session goes further. We’ll explore the creative, practical, and sometimes downright weird techniques used to pull code out of tightly locked or poorly-designed devices: hardware tricks, boot-time observations, unintended debug paths, and other approaches that blur the line between hardware, software, and analysis. Whether you’re new to firmware or a seasoned reverser, you’ll leave with a richer toolbox and a few ideas you probably haven’t tried yet." Speaker Bio:

Talk: Speakers Names: John Franolich  &  Zachary Jones  Time 18:15 - 19:00 Q/A 15 mintes  Talk Title : "Accelerate [Cyber Security] Workforce Readiness by Leveraging ML for Adaptive Learning" Description : "This talk proposes a novel approach to AI-enabled learning models, which uncover efficiencies and economics of the learning process. We will discuss how this open the doors to a new approach to student learning.

By leveraging ML structures intrinsic to AI, we can facilitate student learning in ways that have historically been inaccessible. Similar to how LLMs process information, these structures can translate into new learning dynamics and efficiencies. Thus: Learning Economies.

We will approach this topic from the perspective of Cybersecurity practitioner and educators. The NIST 800-181 structure, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) and development, includes KSA (knowledge skills abilities), testable statements, measures, and related roles.

We will cover four (4) pillars of Learning Economies: depth, breath, granular, and emergent. The first three bear comparison to traditional learning paths of PhD research programs, multi-degree programs, and vocational programs.

This presentation will explore the value in actively engaging AI technology to enhance educators' ability to deliver outcomes across an increasingly diverse body of students and adaptive programs. AI can support educators with templates, and frameworks, that provide adaptive measures of students' development of critical thinking skills. This approach is especially important for accelerating the development of industry competencies for a rapidly changing world."
